       <h2>About Tolstoy's childhood </h2>
       
       <p> On September 9, 1828, writer Leo Tolstoy was born at his family's estate, Yasnaya Polyana,<br>
       in the Tula Province of Russia. He was the youngest of four boys. When Tolstoy's mother died in 1830,<br>
       his father's cousin took over caring for the children. When their father, Count Nikolay Tolstoy, died just<br>
       seven years later, their aunt was appointed their legal guardian. When the aunt passed away,<br>
       Tolstoy and his siblings moved in with a second aunt, in Kazan, Russia. Although Tolstoy experienced<br>
       <em>a lot of loss at an early age </em>, he would later <strong>idealize his childhood memories in his writing.<strong>

      <h2>About his life</h2>
      
      <p> Over the last 30 years of his life, Tolstoy established himself as a moral and religious leader. His ideas about nonviolent resistance<br>
      to evil influenced the likes of social leader Mahatma Gandhi. Also during his later years, Tolstoy reaped the rewards of international acclaim. Yet he<br>
      still struggled to reconcile his spiritual beliefs with the tensions they created in his home life. His wife not only disagreed with his<br>
      teachings, but she also disapproved of his disciples, who regularly visited Tolstoy at the family estate. Their troubled marriage took on<br>
      an air of notoriety in the press. Anxious to escape his wife's growing resentment, in October 1910, Tolstoy, his daughter, Aleksandra, and<br>
      his physician,  Dr. Dushan P. Makovitski, embarked on a pilgrimage. Valuing their privacy, they traveled incognito, hoping to dodge the press, to no avail.<br>
